Echo Maze is a maze game where you can't see the whole maze but only you surroundings. You have to try to solve the maze and try to get all the stars using your memory and intuition. However, to help you out, there is an echo button that reveals the map for a brief moment that you can use to solve it. The maze has 20 levels and all account data is saved locally. The game comes with a how to play section as well.

Just to clarify about ai use, I am failry new to css and js so I have used ai to learn how to do specific things in my project like level generation and more. I have used ai asa tool to guide me through this project with logic and more. However, all the code in this project is handwritten by me. And, in the end, I have used ai to organize my code in an order and foramt that is easier to read since I am a pretty messy and unorganized coder. All it did was rearange code that I already wrote in a more accessible and more efficient format and more readable format. All the code was written by me though.

I hope you guys enjoy the game, let me know about anything I can do to fix it.
